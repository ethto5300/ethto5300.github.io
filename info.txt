About

eth to $5300 is a meme focused around the meta that eth will soon pump to 5300. While taking this probablity into consideration
we created a coin on eth(base) that has a %1 tax that is directly distirbuted among holders as weth rewards. Witht the hope and faith that 
eth will pump to 5300 to it's ath. 


Why & How to buy ?

1 - Depending one some researcha nd analysis we are convinced that eth should pump up at least to $5300 and Depending
on the carts we're just about to start the ETH rally. This meme is mixing the prediction of Benjamin Cowen as in the above
video and crating a meme on base 5300. 

2 - What would be better than excepting eth to pump to 5300 buy a token that's paired with eth and that gives on volume to all holders
fully deentralized and fully automated rewards in wETH.

3 - Taxed projects are not so loved at general but what's the difference here? Here we just have %1 of tax on buy/sell
so the token is almost 0 - Tax and most importantly all the collected tax from trading volume will get back to holders
no MW no cheating.

4 - Open to your favorite exchange and withdraw how much ETH u whish on base to your decentralized wallet address.

5 - Navigate to: https://app.uniswap.org/ paste in the contract address found on the tokenomics section and swap some eth
to $5300 tokens.
